# SkillTreeApp
Skill Tree app for Borderlands 2 because there isn't one that I like out there. WIP

To start it will not take into account the skills unique to a specific vault hunter such as Axton's Sentry skill that effects only his turrets.

Needs: 



Wants: 
-   GUI
-   Better runtime speed
-   Improve the structure of the Driver class, needs better decomposition


Issues: 
-   Loads of them


Spitballs: 

-   Maybe could change the structure so that there is a Vault Hunter object that then the different VH's are made from.

-   Expand the Skill class so that its easier to work with individual skills.

-   Input skill data from a CSV instead of it being baked in
