Needs: 



Wants: 
-   GUI
-   Better runtime speed
-   Improve the structure of the Driver class, needs better decomposition


Issues: 
-   Loads of them


Spitballs: 

-   Maybe could change the structure so that there is a Vault Hunter object that then the different VH's are made from.

-   Expand the Skill class so that its easier to work with individual skills.
